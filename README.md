# Today I learned
## About
This is a collection of small write-ups on stuff I learn, that can become usefull some day. Some of this *might* be included in blogpost on [rikosjett.com](https://www.rikosjett.com). If so, I will link to the post.

This repo takes inspiration from @charliegerard's [dev-notes](https://github.com/charliegerard/dev-notes) and this tweet.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I find regularly writing quick notes about the stuff I learn so helpful. It can be about something really small, it doesn’t matter! It really helps me remember &amp; realise how much I’m learning. Last night I wrote my 100th note! 🎉 <a href="https://t.co/xf9TCxFCA1">https://t.co/xf9TCxFCA1</a></p>&mdash; Charlie Gerard 🏳️‍🌈 (@devdevcharlie) <a href="https://twitter.com/devdevcharlie/status/1019343097749168128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

# Today I learned
## About
This is a collection of small write-ups on stuff I learn, that could become usefull some day. Some of this *might* be included in blogposts on [rikosjett.com](https://www.rikosjett.com). If so, I will link to the post.

This repo originally takes inspiration from @charliegerard's [dev-notes](https://github.com/charliegerard/dev-notes) and this [tweet](https://twitter.com/devdevcharlie/status/1019343097749168128). The refactor to using Github Issues is inspired by the amazing DJ Adams(@qmacro) and his [Thinking Aloud](https://github.com/qmacro/thinking-aloud).
